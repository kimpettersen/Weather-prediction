This is a small project I am working on to learn how to work with REST api and how to implement machine learning.

Important steps of the project:
*Manually label existing images taken from a web camera
*Run different analysis on each image and register it in the database
*Run the data through a learning algorithm
*Make the data available through a REST api

*Analyzer:
Python package reponsible for running different analysis for the images already in the system.
It contains a package called analysis where all the analysis are stored. To enable/disable an analysis
you have to add/remove it from the enabled_analysis list in Analyzer.py

*Exception:
User defined exceptions

*Preparation_scripts:
Scripts to prepare the system for analysis, such as import existing images

*learner_app:
Pyramid application that are displying images and registering weather on an existing image. Used to manually 
collect data to learn from.

Built with:
*Python
*PIL
*Pyramid
*MongoDb
*pymongo
